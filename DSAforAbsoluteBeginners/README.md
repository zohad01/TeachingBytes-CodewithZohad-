üìö DSA for Absolute Beginners ‚Äì iCodeGuru
This repository contains the recordings, resources, and practice problems from the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) for Absolute Beginners course I co-trained at iCodeGuru.

Over the course of 6 interactive weeks (July 1 ‚Äì August 8, 2025), we worked with enthusiastic learners to build strong foundations in problem-solving, logical thinking, and efficient coding practices using Python. Our focus was to make DSA approachable for beginners while also training them to think like programmers who can solve real-world challenges and prepare for technical interviews.

This was a volunteer-driven learning initiative, designed to give back to the tech community and empower aspiring developers with the skills and confidence they need to grow.

A heartfelt thanks to Sir Zafar Shahid, PhD and Sir Rizwan Ghafar for providing an incredible platform, continuous mentorship, and encouragement to share knowledge with the next generation of programmers.

üìå Topics Covered
Throughout the journey, we explored:

Introduction to DSA ‚Äì Core concepts, time & space complexity, and Big-O notation

Arrays & Strings ‚Äì Traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation

Two-Pointer Technique ‚Äì Problem-solving patterns for arrays and strings

Hashing & Sliding Window ‚Äì Optimizing searches and subarray problems

Linked Lists ‚Äì Singly, doubly, and circular lists

Stacks & Queues ‚Äì Implementations and applications

Recursion Basics ‚Äì Understanding call stacks and problem breakdown

Sorting & Searching ‚Äì Classic algorithms and binary search

Trees ‚Äì Fundamental concepts and basic problems

üéì Interactive Learning
One of the highlights of this course was the interactive approach:

Weekly topic explanations with dry runs of concepts

Daily LeetCode problem-solving (2‚Äì3 problems)

Student presentations explaining problems and walking through code

Discussions on optimal approaches, code clarity, and efficiency

Special appreciation to active participants Najma Razzaq and Abdul Rehman for their dedication, thoughtful questions, and making the sessions truly engaging.
